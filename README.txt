To fully compile and run the WS3DApp you will have to compile it together with two other libraries:

- The WS3DProxy Library: https://github.com/CST-Group/WS3DProxy
- The CST Library: https://github.com/CST-Group/cst

The files containing the libraries cst.jar and WS3DProxy.jar are already included in the source code, in the lib subdirectory. These might not be the last version of these libraries. If necessary, it might be required to download the newest versions of these libraries in order to make it compatible with the ws3d Virtual Environment version. All the code can be found in GitHub. 
Besides that, you will need the ws3d Virtual Environment: https://github.com/CST-Group/ws3d which should be run in an independent process together with WS3DApp. An executable version of ws3d is also included in the lib subdirectory, by the name ws3d.zip. To execute it, you will have to unzip the file first.  
All these libraries were compiled using Netbeans environment. The source code already includes the Netbeans files used by Netbeans to compile the code, so we suggest the use of Netbeans. Nevertheless, the code can also be compiled by Eclipse or any other Java environment.
