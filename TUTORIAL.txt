  This tutorial intends to instruct you on how to start working with World Server 
 3D and perform experiments with it using the Tricog Cognitive architecture.
 
  Libraries for both the WordlServer3D (WS3D) and the cognitive architecture are available at this 
  very same server and can be downloaded as new projects in Eclipse.
  
   More information on WS3D and Tricog can be seen in the following articles:

   In order to have this application up and running, you must perform the following steps using Eclipse:
   

1) After downloading this project, go to "Configure Build Path..." and add the jars from "lib" folder.
Now, add the jar containing the cognitive architecture (tricog_v****.jar). 
 
 At this point, there should be no errors in your WordlServer3DApplication project.
 
2) Run a WorldServer3D server at your local machine

3) Run Experiment0 from: br.unicamp.cogsys.worldServer3DApplication.experiments

It should start creating some apples in WS3D and then should create a robot creature.
The cognitive architecture loaded in Experiment0 will control the creature in such a 
way that it will go after the closest apple on sight, and eat it when it gets close enough.

Note: At current implementation, WS3D might produce a few null pointer exceptions regarding
 GetFullStatus3D command in Main.java. It should stop by itself after a few moments.
